  - jac: ready to use package with IDE, samples.

  - jac-src: bare CVS sources export for hackers and
    developpers. You'll need at least the patched jhotdraw
    (see jhotdraw.jar) in order to compile everything. For your
    convenience, all the jars required to compile are packaged in
    jac-libs.

  - jac-libs: all the jars of the libs you'll need to compile
    from the sources. It contains the following files:

        lib/bcel.jar
        lib/gnu-regexp.jar
        lib/cup.jar
        lib/log4j-1.2.jar
        lib/opt/

    and want to avoid a multi-MB download, you can just download the
    patched JHotDraw librarie.>>>>>>> 1.5.2.1
