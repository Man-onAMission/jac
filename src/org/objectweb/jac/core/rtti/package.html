<p>Provides an aspect that contructs some RTTI (Run-Time Type
Informations) for the classes that need it on the top of a structural
    metamodel (extending <code>java.lang.reflect</code>).</p>

<p>The RTTI are a metamodel that is close to the
<code>java.lang.reflect</code> metamodel but more precise (actually
it wraps it and adds some extra informations).</p>

<p>It allows the programmer to easily build some informations that
can be useful for other aspects such as the Persistence or the Gui
aspects. Typically, these aspects may want to access some more precise
informations about which fields are read or written by a given method
(so that they can decide to update the object storage or the object
view).</p>

<p>The access point to the runtime informations is
<code>ClassRepository</code> that allows the client program to
retrieve <code>ClassItem</code> instances, where the informations are
stored.</p>

<p>The RTTI configuration API is given by the <code>RttiConf</code>
interface.</p>
