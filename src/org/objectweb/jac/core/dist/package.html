Provides JAC system core classes for distribution and remote communication.

    <p>A JAC distributed system is composed of several JAC containers
      accessible with the <code>RemoteContainer</code> class. Each container
      launches a <code>Distd</code> deamon that listen for remote calls and
      instantiations.
      
    <p>To simply access a remote object located on a remote container, the
      programmer can instantiate the <code>RemoteRef</code> class.
      
    <p>Note that this package is generic. It is specialized in
      personalities for each
      communication protocol that need to be supported by JAC (see
      <code>org.objectweb.jac.core.dist</code> subpackages):
      
    <ul>
      <li>RMI (default)</li>
      <li>CORBA (not up-to-date anymore)</li>
      <li>SOAP (should be available soon)</li>
    </ul>
