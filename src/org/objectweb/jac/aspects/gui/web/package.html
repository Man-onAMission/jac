    <title>Gui Aspect</title>
  </head>

  <body>

    <p>Provides a simple and generic GUI (Graphical User Interface)
      aspect generating HTML pages.</p>

    <p>This aspect is based on a MVC (Model-View-Controller)
      pattern. The GUI aspect component wrapps all the objects of the
      application that need to be displayed with a view wrapper that
      plays the controller role. The view is generic and is
      implemented by the <code>View</code> class. It simply displays
      the objects fields values and add some buttons for the commands
      that correspond to the class methods.</p>

    <p>It supports arrays, collections, and maps displaying.</p>

    <p>The configuration file lets you specify how objects should be
      displayed. You can control which fields are shown and in which
      order for instance. You can also specify the name of methods
      parameters.</p>

    <p>Two guis are available : a swing gui, based on Java's swing
      components, and a web gui which generates HTML pages. They both
      use the configuration of the gui aspect, which means that you do
      not have to write two configuration files, however due to
      constraint of each implementation, some gui may not use all
      settings of the gui aspect. For instance, the
      <code>setRender</code> configuration method only has an effect
      in the swing gui.</p>

    <p>If you want to create a customized GUI for a given application,
    you must implement the org.objectweb.jac.core.Display interface and use the
    <code>setDisplay</code> configuration method to launch it.
