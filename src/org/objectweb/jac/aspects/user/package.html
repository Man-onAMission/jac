    <p>Provides a users management within an application. </p>
    
    <p>Any class of the application can be declared as a user
      representation. The aspect configurator should then declare which
      are the fields of this class that corresponds to the user's id
      (that is used to login) and to the password (not required). Users
      can then be bounded to profiles that define what are the elements
      of the application that have the right to access or not.</p>
