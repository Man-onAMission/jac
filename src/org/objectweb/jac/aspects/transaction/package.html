Provides an aspect that handles transactional operations within JAC
programs.

<p>For the moment, no hierarchical transactions are supported.

<p>The implementation is really simple and consists in cloning all the
      objects that take part on the transaction and to work on them on
      the transactionnal flow. When the transaction is commited, the
      states of the clones are copied to the original objects.

<p>This transaction implementation also works in distributed mode if
      the transaction wrapper (that is also a coordinator) can reach
      the transaction participants from its host.

<p>The configuration of this aspect consists in
      denoting a set of transactional methods.
