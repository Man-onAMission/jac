Provides a basic and generic support for JAC thin clients.

<p>The main class of this package is the <code>AbstractServer</code>
class. It defines all the methods that a programmer should implement
to support any kind of thin client that respects the Jac Thinclient
Protocol (JTP) specifications.

<p>The JTP defines 6 requests. All of them takes as a first
parameter the session ID (sid) that must be unique for each client.

<ul>
<li><b>viewRequest(sid,jid)</b>: allows the client to open a view 
on an object called "jid" within the accessed JAC container
<li><b>refreshRequest(sid)</b>: allows the client to refresh the 
current  view
<li><b>newRequest(sid,className)</b>: allows the client to 
instantiate a new object of the given class and opens a view on 
this new object 
<li><b>closeRequest(sid)</b>: allows the client to close the current
wiew (the previous view is re-opened) 
<li><b>invokeRequest(sid,jid,methodName)</b>: allows the client to 
invoke a method called "method" on an object called "jid" within the 
accesed JAC container; if some parameters are needed by the invoked
method, the server will automatically open an input form to allow 
the user to fill their values and that invocation process is 
suspended until an input request occurs
<li><b>inputRequest(sid,methodName,params)</b>: allows the client 
to give to the server the parameters values that correspond to the 
given method invocation (this request should be send when the 
invoke request ask the client for the parameters); it then restart
the waiting invocation request
<li><b>cancelInputRequest(sid,methodName)</b>: allows the client 
to cancel the current invocation during the parameters imput
process 
</ul>

<p>As a simple instance, you can refer to the
<code>org.objectweb.jac.aspects.gui.WebGui</code> class that implements a server for
WEB clients (a simple kind of thin clients).
