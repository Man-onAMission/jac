Provides a highly configurable set of aspects to distribute JAC
applications.

<p>The core aspect for ditribution is <code>DeploymentAC</code>. It
allows the user to easily define various deployment schemes by
defining deployment rules (see <code>DeploymentRule</code>) on the
objects of the application.

<p>Here is a sample deployment configuration:

<pre class=code>
// deploys 4 instances of Calcul on a remote JAC server 
// called //oil/s3
deploy "calcul[1-3]" "//oil/s3"

// replicates calcul0 on all the hosts of the topology
replicate "calcul0" ".*"

// create remote access stubs for calcul2 on all the hosts 
// of the topology
createStubsFor "calcul2" "//oil/s3" ".*"
</pre>

<p>Note that, to be accessible, the JAC servers must be declared in
      the <code>org.objectweb.jac.prop</code> of the application by defining the
      <code>org.objectweb.jac.topology</code> property.

<p>Other aspects enables the programmer to install various protocols
      when the objects are deployed on a topology.

<ul><li>the consistency aspect (ConsistencyAC): if several objects of
	the same name are deployed on several hosts of the topology,
	they can be regarded as replicas and made consistent with
	various protocols</li>
<li>the broadcasting aspect (BroadcastingAC): allows the user to
	define a broadcasted object on a given host that will
	broadcast all the received calls to a set of remote objects
	(of the same name)</li>
<li>the load-balancing aspect (LoadBalancingAC): quite the same
	principles as the broadcasting but the load-balancer only
	picks up one remote object that is different for each
	invocation (then, if sevral clients use the object, the load
	is statistically equally distributed over the set of remote
	hosts).<li>
</ul>
