Provides an aspect that handles sessions within JAC programs.

<p>In JAC, sessions are simply handled by saving a defined set of
attributes of the collaborations and make them corespond to a session
id.

<p>The current session id is defined as a context attribute called
"Session.sid". This attribute must be set by the client before
initiating a collaboration if he wants its collaborations
characteritics to be memorized and restored for each new interaction.

<p>The session aspect is useful since that if it is not woven, the
user will have to input several times the same informations again and
again such as its password to access a restricted method.

<p>A typical configuration for the session aspect is to save the
      authentication contextual information saved by the
      authentication aspect (see package
      <code>org.objectweb.jac.aspects.authentication</code>) so that the user will
      not have to authenticate on each access to the objects:

<pre class=code>
declareStoredAttributes {"Authentication.user"}
</pre>
