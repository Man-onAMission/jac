    <p>Provides an aspect that allows the programmer to define methods that
      must be confirmed by the user before commiting.</p>

    <p>A confirmation box is most of the time used when a critical method
      is called. For instance, a remover that deletes an object from a
      collection. Adding all these confirmation boxes is most of the
      time a croscutting concern and is very uninteresting to
      program.

    <p>By using this aspect, the user can easily ask for a confirmation
      box to a set of methods. For instance, to confirm all the
      removers:

<pre class=code>
confirm ALL REMOVERS ALL;
</pre>
