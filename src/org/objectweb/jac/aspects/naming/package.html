Provides an aspect to handle the naming in the JAC system.

<p>The naming package can be separated in two parts.

<ul> <li>A naming aspect component that automatically names the
objects that are created by the application. By default, the naming
names the objects by lowercasing their class names and by adding the
current instances count for the class. However, this aspect component
can be particularize by the programmer to implement naming policies
that fits its application needs (for instance, it can implement a
context-dependent naming policies).

<li>A binding aspect that allows unresolved named references to be
bounded to actual objects. Typically, the binding aspect can be used
when a JAC object is moved to a remote container and that the system
needs to resolve its set of references.
</ul>
