    <h1><a name="0.12">What's new in JAC 0.12</a></h1>

    <p class="important">Because of some internal changes in the way
      RTTI information is cached, you must clear you <span
	class="directory">classes_BCEL</span> directory.</p>

    <h2>Core/Aspect programming model</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
    	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/aopalliance">AOP Alliance</a> API support<br/>
    	as a consequence:
    	<ul>
	  <li>wrappers must now implement two methods:
	    <a href="http://aopalliance.sourceforge.net/doc/org/aopalliance/intercept/MethodInterceptor.html"><i>invoke</i></a> and
	    <a href="http://aopalliance.sourceforge.net/doc/org/aopalliance/intercept/ConstructorInterceptor.html"><i>construct</i></a>.
	    <i>invoke</i> wraps method executions and
	    <i>construct</i> wraps constructor executions.</li>
    		
	  <li>the <i>pointcut</i> method signature has changed
	    (no more wrapping method name).</li>
    	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h2>Core/RTTI</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Added support for <em>import</em> statement in .acc files</li>
      <li>New configuration method in RTTI: defineRepository. It
	allows to specify that when the instances of a class are
	requested (with ObjectRepository.getObjects(ClassItem), instead
	of returning all instances of the class known by the system,
	just return a collection of a so-called repository
	object.</li>
      <li>Fixed some bytecode analysis bugs with doubles.</li>
      <li>Added clone() utility method to clone an object and it's
	relations if they are aggregations (see
	o.o.jac.core.Utils.clone)</li>
      <li>Field dependencies can be declared for expression
	fields. See RttiConf.addFieldDependency() configuration
	method.</li>
      <li>Log messages contain date and time.</li>
      <li>acc files: Fixed a bug in negated( those with a "!") 
	expression parsing</li>
      <li>log4j is used so that we can we just4log and not suffer a
	performance loss for unactivated logs</li>
      <li>defineRepository can be used with any expression field for
	the collection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>New aspect: timestamp</h2>

    <p>Register last modification dates of objects.</p>

    <h2>Cache</h2>

    <p>Can now work with the timestamp aspect.</p>

    <h2>New aspect: export</h2>

    <p>It's not really an aspect since it does not use any wrapper,
      but it's configured like an aspect. It can export object to an
      XML file and, of course, import the objects back from that kind
      of file.</p>

    <h2>IDE</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Packages can contain resources, which can be edited with an
	external program</li>
      <li>Introduced per user config</li>
      <li>Fixed application main class setting</li>
      <li>Can build a jar containing classes, aspect configuration
	files and jac application descriptors.</li>
      <li>Added "goto line" feature on classes.</li>
      <li>Add export/import</li>
      <li>com.sun.tools.javac can be used as the compiler for better 
	performances</li>
      <li>Added options to debug applications with standard java debugger</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>GUI</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Enhanced calculated field refresh (see RttiConf.addFieldDependency)</li>
      <li>Web: pressing enter in an editor of the embedded to add
	object of a table adds the object (javascript)</li>
      <li>Web: Double clicking on a table's row views the object
	(equivalent to clicking the "view" link)</li>
      <li>Swing: in the file editor, "~" at the beginning of a
	filename is replaced by the user's home directory</li>
      <li>Added percentage editor and viewer</li>
      <li>new config method setSlowOperation() to display "please wait"
	message for slow methods</li>
      <li>Dialog boxes now have OK/Cancel/Refresh buttons</li>
      <li>Use local format to edit and display floating point
      numbers</li>
      <li>Tree nodes are sorted</li>
      <li>Length are specified using units such px, ex or em
	instead of dual pixels/characters values.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Persistence</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Added support for multiple storages</li>
      <li>FSStorage: do not create empty files</li>
      <li>FSStorage: encoding of files can be specified</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Confirmation</h2>

    <h1><a name="0.8">What's new in JAC 0.8</a></h1>

    <h2>IDE</h2>

    <p>An IDE in a very first beta version is added (not documented
    yet). The idea it to allow the programmer to model its
    applications in a UML-like formalism. The diagrams editors are
    implemented by using the excellent JHotDraw framework.

    <p>See the <code>org/objectweb/jac/src/org/objectweb/jac/ide</code> directory of the
    distribution (launch with <code>jac ide.jac</code>).

    <p>For the moment, the IDE supports (still in a very beta state):
      
    <ul>
      <li>Modeling of base programs (classes, relations)</li>
      <li>Modeling of aspects (aspect, pointcut links)</li>
      <li>Code generation: once modeled, the code can be generated and
      compiled</li>
      <li>Applications definitions and aspects configuration</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Swing GUI</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>The state of tree views is not lost anymore</li>
      <li>fixed lots of bugs (refresh problems and exceptions)</li>
      <li>be more clever when wrapping with askForParamaters</li> 
      <li>columns of table can be configured per collection</li>
      <li>Added support for menus (see setMenuBar and addMenuItem in GuiAC)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Web GUI</h2>

    <p>Introduced a component architecture similar to the one used for
      Swing. See setHTMLTypeViewer and setHTMLTypeEditor of
      org.objectweb.jac.aspect.gui.GuiAC.</p>

    <h2>Association</h2>

    <p>There's a new association aspect. It can be used to
      automatically updated opposite roles. See the declareAssociation
      of org.objectweb.jac.core.rtti.RttiAC.</p>
    
    <h2>Configuration files</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed empty file and missing last ";" bugs</li>
      <li>FieldItem can be used in configuration methods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Windows</h2>

    <p>There's now a jac2000.bat for Windows2000 and a jac98.bat for
      Windows98.</p>
    
    <h1><a name="0.7">What's new in JAC 0.7</a></h1>

    <h2>Configuration files parsing</h2>

    <p>Better error reporting : line numbers should be accurate.</p>

    <p>The <a href="/doc/aspects_config.html#grouping">syntax for
    blocks</a> was improved to allow multiple values.</p>

    <p>Multi-line C-style comments are allowed (/* comments
    .... */).</p>

    <h2>Persistence</h2>
    
    <p>A filesystem storage was implemented. It allows you to store
      objects without having to setup a database.</p>

    <p>It is no longer necessary to declare wrapped collections in
    configuration files.</p>

    <h2>Transactions</h2>

    <p>There is a new aspect to manage transactions. See the bank
      sample application for an example how to use it. It is still
      very basic. Expect problems when concurrent transactions
      occur for instance (the collections modifications merging is not
      implemented yet).</p>

    <h2>Synchronization</h2>

    <p>Added a simple synchronization aspect.</p>

    <h2>GUI</h2>

    <p>You can now embbed views in the Swing GUI.</p>

    <p>A customized GUI (with up to 4 panels) can easily be created.</p>

    <p>Added a tree view.</p>

    <p>Better handling of multiple modal boxes.</p>

    <p>By default, changes in embedded editor are automatically
    updated when the editor losts its focus.</p>

    <p>Possiblity to have commit/cancel buttons for view with embedded
    editors (when you do not want implicit updates).</p>

    <h2>Core</h2>

    <p>Garbage collector (not activated for the moment).</p>

    <h1><a name="0.6">What's new in JAC 0.6</a></h1>

    <h2>Configuration files parsing</h2>

    <p>We have changed the syntax of the *.acc files to make it
    cleaner (there is now a real parser -- Cup -- with a real grammar
    behind). JAC also supports *.xml parsing thanks to Zac's
    contribution. For more details, see <a
    href="doc/aspects_config.html"> documentation on configuration
    syntaxes.</a>

    <h2>Application descriptors (*.jac)</h2>

    <p>The application and the aspects it contains are not declared
    anymore in a launching class but in a JAC application descriptor
    (*.jac).

    <p>For instance, if you had a calcul application defined as
      following:

<pre class=code>
import org.objectweb.jac.core.*;
public class Run {
   public static void main( String[] args )
   {
      Application app = new Application("calcul",null,
                                        "Run",null);
      app.addAcConfiguration( 
         new ACConfiguration( app, "rtti", 
                              "rtti.acc", true ) );
      app.addAcConfiguration( 
         new ACConfiguration( app, "gui", 
                              "gui.acc", true ) );
      ApplicationRepository.get().addApplication( app );
      Calcul myCalcul = new Calcul();
   }
}
</pre>

    <p>The new way of defining this is:

<pre class=code>
// calcul.jac file
applicationName: calcul
launchingClass: Run
aspects: \
  rtti mydirectory/rtti.acc true \
  gui mydirectory/gui.acc true
</pre>

<pre class=code>
public class Run {
   public static void main( String[] args ) {
      Calcul myCalcul = new Calcul();
   }
}
</pre>

    <p>Consequently, launching a JAC application have changed to:

<pre class=code>
jac [options] calcul.jac
</pre>

    <p>What is interesting about this new feature is that you do
      not need to compile again the launching program even when you
      want to change the way the application declares its aspects.
      
    <h2>Distribution enhancements</h2>

    <p>Distribution is now more flexible since each application can
    defines its own topology in the corresponding application
    descriptor. For instance:

<pre class=code>
// calcul.jac file
applicationName: calcul
launchingClass: Run
aspects: \
  rtti mydirectory/rtti.acc true \
  gui mydirectory/gui.acc true \
  deployment mydirectory/deployment.acc true
topology: //localhost/s2
</pre>

    <p>This means that the <code>org.objectweb.jac.topology</code> property of the
    <code>org.objectweb.jac.prop</code> file is not effective anymore.

    <p>Furthermore, the application that defines a topology
    automatically binds its launching container to the containers of
    the topology (creating an aspect-space). This topology can be
    dynamically modified if the aspects allow it thanks to a new event
    that notifies all the aspects when the topology is changed. 

    <h2>New launching options</h2>

<pre class=code>    
// launches an administration GUI on the container //localhost/s2
jac -A //localhost/s2

// write all the logs (here the gui logs) into a log file
jac -V gui -L org.objectweb.jac.log -G myapp.jac

// the -D option can take a container name as argument (the 
// default value is still //localhost/s0
jac -D s3
</pre>

    <p>As a consequence of the last improvement of the -D option and
    of the distribution enhancement, the -S (slave) option has been
    removed.

    <h2>GUI</h2>

    <p>Some bugs fixed, added embedded editors in a general way.

    <p>Auto-creation configuration methods added (See
    org.objectweb.jac.aspects.gui.GuiAC), available on the WEB or for Swing).

    <h1><a name="0.5.2">What's new in JAC 0.5.2</a></h1>

    <h2>Fixings</h2>

    <p>It appeared that JAC 0.5.1 had several bugs in the GUI and the
    distribution. Most of them should be fixed.

    <h2>GUI</h2>

    <p>Multi-line text editor added in the GUI.
      
    <p>We also added a WEB GUI sample reachable from the WEB on the
 8081 port: 
      <a
      href="http://org.objectweb.jac.aopsys.com:8081/org/objectweb/jac/servlet/JacServlet?action=view&jid=photorepository0">Live
      demo of the photos sample (still unstable)</a>.

    <h2>Distribution</h2>
    
    <p>A remote access aspect
    (org.objectweb.jac.aspects.distribution.RemoteAccessAC) allows JAC clients to
    seamlessly access JAC servers.

<h2>Samples</h2>

    <p>A simple but full application added. See the
    org.objectweb.jac.samples.contacts package.

    <p>It is an application that defines its own SWING GUI. It can be
    very useful to refer to it since several used features are
    not yet documented in the tutorial.

<p>It can also be launched in a server mode:

<pre class=code>

<p>And in a client mode that uses the data of the launched server
      instead of local objects (this is a demo on how to use the
      remote access aspect).

    <h1><a name="0.5.1">What's new in JAC 0.5.1</a></h1>

    <h2>Configuration files</h2>

    <p>Error messages for configuration files should now make more sense. </p>
    
    <p>Quoting values in configuration files is not mandatory any more,
      and you can declare configuration methods with parameters of type
      double, int, long, float, boolean, short, Class, ClassItem and
      AbstractMethodItem.</p>


    <h2>Pointcuts</h2>

    <p>Pointcuts were enhanced to support path expressions.  This new
      feature is called an OPath and is widely inspired from
      XPath... For instance, if you have the following program:</p>

<pre class=code>
class Bank {
    Vector accounts;  // Account instances
     ....
}
class Account {
    Vector owners;  // Person instances
    ....
}
class Person {
    ...
}
</pre>

    <p>Imagine you do not know the names of the accounts or persons
      objects but that you want to apply an aspect (e.g. a debugging
      aspect) to the accounts that belong to a bank called
      "bank0". Then, in the object expression of the pointcut
      definition, you simply write:</p>

<pre class=code>
bank0/accounts/.*

Same if you need to denote all the persons that owns an account in "bank0":

bank0/accounts/.*/owners/.*

This is powerful. Each path element is a regular expression. Thus, if
you want to get all the objects related to "bank0" by any relation:

bank0/.*/.*
</pre>

    <p>See <a href="doc/programmer_guide.html">
	the JAC programmer's guide for more details.</a>


      <h2>GUI aspect</h2>

    <p>It is now easier to add custom editors and viewers for new
      types of values. See GuiAC.setTypeViewer and
      GuiAC.setTypeEditor.</p>

    <p>Introduced currency handling. You can declare a default
      currency and secondary currencies with their change rate. Then
      if you declare an attibute to be of type "currency" (see
      RttiAC.setFieldType) it's editor will allow you to enter the
      value in one a the declared currencies and will do the
      conversion. See GuiAC.setDefaultCurrency and
      GuiAC.declareCurrency.</p>

    <p>The format to be used for dates can be set once for all (see
      GuiAC.setDateFormat). It is use by the date viewer and the date
      editor for more consistency.</p>

    <p>Tables are refreshed (more or less :-).</p>

    <p>The layout of swing components is tighter so views take less
      room.</p>

    <p>And the usual bunch of bug fixes.</p>


    <h1><a name="0.5">What's new in JAC 0.5</h1>
    
    <p><em>First, considering several remarks, we have decided to now
      furnish JAC under the LGPL. This clarifies the fact that, for
      us, all the developped aspects and application classes that run
      with JAC are NOT submitted to the license. Of course,
      modifications of the JAC system classes or of the furnished
      aspects a subject to the LGPL.</em></p>

    <h2>Big changes in distribution</h2>

    <p>The distribution aspect has been removed and replaced by a set
      of useful aspects to perform distribution (all these aspects are
      still in the distribution package):</p>

    <p>The core aspect for ditribution is DeploymentAC. It allows the
      user to easily define various deployment schemes by defining
      deployment rules (see DeploymentRule) on the objects of the
      application.</p>

    <p>Here is a sample deployment configuration:</p>

<pre class=code>
    // deploys 4 instances of Calcul on a remote JAC server 
    // called //oil/s3
    deploy "calcul[1-3]" "//oil/s3"

    // replicates calcul0 on all the hosts of the topology
    replicate "calcul0" ".*"

    // create remote access stubs for calcul2 on all the hosts 
    // of the topology
    createStubsFor "calcul2" "//oil/s3" ".*"
</pre>

    <p>Note that, to be accessible, the JAC servers must be declared
      in the org.objectweb.jac.prop of the application by defining the org.objectweb.jac.topology
      property.</p>

    <p>Other aspects enables the programmer to install various
      protocols once the objects are deployed on a topology (the
      deployment aspect is always applied first).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the consistency aspect (ConsistencyAC): if several objects
	of the same name are deployed on several hosts of the
	topology, they can be regarded as replicas and made consistent
	with various protocols</li>

      <li>the broadcasting aspect (BroadcastingAC): allows the user to
	define a broadcasted object on a given host that will
	broadcast all the recieved calls to a set of remote objects
	(of the same name)</li>

      <li>the load-balancing aspect (LoadBalancingAC): quite the same
	principles as the broadcasting but the load-balancer only
	picks up one remote object that is different for each
	invocation (then, if sevral clients use the object, the load
	is statistically equally distributed over the set of remote
	hosts).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other useful aspects will be provided in next release (and
      these ones will be enhanced).</p>

    <h2>Other new feature</h2>
    
    <p>The aspect configurations are fetched from the JAC server that
      is the class repository (note: the classes are fetched from it
      so that the .class files of the application do not have to be
      installed on the remote hosts).</p>

    <p>Hence, the aspect configurations are consistent all over the
      topology and you do not need to deploy them.</p>

    <h2>Pointcut expressions enhanced!</h2>

    <p>A pointcut expression defines a set of base objects and methods
      that need to be wrapped by a given wrapping method.</p>

    <p>In JAC 0.4.3, these expressions where standard regular
      expressions that were quite uneasy to write and read. We have
      changed this.</p>

    <p>A pointcut expression is still based on regular expressions but
      you can compose them with the && (logical and), || (logical or),
      and the !  (NOT) operators. Moreover, you can use keywords in
      the expressions so that it is most of the time very easy to
      denote a set of methods. Some small examples are better than a
      long description of the syntax. So, let's give some
      configuration example of the tracing aspect that uses pointcut
      expression as an input for the "trace" configuration method:</p>
      
<pre class=code>
    // traces all the calls on all the objects of the system
    trace ".*" ".*" ".*"
</pre>
<p>OR:</p>

<pre class=code>
    trace "ALL" "ALL" "ALL"
  
    // traces all the calls on all the methods of all the instances of
    // classes A and B
    trace ".*" "A || B" ".*"

    // traces all the calls on all the methods of the first instances
    // of classes A and B (their names ends with 0)
    trace ".*0" "A || B" ".*"

    // restricts the trace to the f field setters and the f field
    // getter
    trace ".*0" "A || B" "GETTER(f) || SETTER(f)"

    // restricts the trace to all the methods minus the methods that
    // modify the state of the instances
    trace ".*0" "A || B" ".* && !MODIFIERS"

    // traces all the instances of all classes except a0 and only the
    // methods that read the state of the instances or the getName
    // method
    trace ".* && !a0" ".*" "ACCESSORS || getName():String"
</pre>

    <p>Note: the GETTER, SETTER, MODIFIERS and ACCESSORS keywords are
      using the naming conventions and the RTTI aspect to resolve the
      actual methods.</p>


    <h2>Performance improved</h2>

    <p>Jac should now be faster to load, and invocation of wrapped
      methods is also much faster.</p>


    <h2>GUI aspect</h2>

    <p>The Gui aspect was sligthly improved. Editor components now get
      the focus so that you do not have to click on them in order to
      start entering values.</p>

    <p>New configuration methods captureSystemOut and captureSystemErr
      to control wether stdout and stderr are captured and redirected
      into a tab of the GUI.</p>
    
    <p>The Swing GUI now use sessions so that for instance, you do not
      have to enter your username and password each time you invoke a
      method restricted by the authentication aspect.</p>
    
    <p>ComboBoxes can now be editable (see
      <code>GuiAC.setFieldChoice</code> and
      <code>GuiAC.setMethodDynamicParameterChoice</code>). Also, items
      are sorted.</p>
    
    <p>The trace editor now accepts regular expressions in put(). For
      instance, <code>put("gui.*",1)</code> enables all trace
      categories starting with "gui".</p>
    
    <p>InputCanceledExceptions are now silently discarded.</p>


    <h2>Session aspect</h2>

    <p>It is now configurable; you can specify which attributes must
      be saved and restored (See
      <code>SessionAC.declareStoredAttributes</code>).</p>
